# dev-runtime-nodejs
### Overview
Since this develompnet is still in porgress, we give a quick short overview, that will be updated in near future.
This repository  aims to execute the reTHINK runtime core in Node.js. 
The execution of the core runtime takes place in an subprocess(child process) which isolates it from the main process (the process node where the App javascript code is being executed first). 

##### Quick Start
First you need to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-nodejs.git
cd dev-runtime-nodejs
```

Afterwards, run the following :

```
# npm install
# npm start
```
